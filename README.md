# data-table-resources
A single-page, searchable data table for collecting links to useful articles, tools, and resources.

Based on the following design and technology:

[Bootstrap 3 Data Table] (https://datatables.net/examples/styling/bootstrap.html)

[A simple table design] (http://codepen.io/jasen1/pen/wgrNvE)

Powered by jQuery, and must run on localhost or a server to work correctly.

Be sure to remove restrictions on image permissions, set to at least "read only"

In your spreadsheet, the URLs need to lead with http:// or https:// or else the links will break

Tip: Check if your links are broken by using the Chrome Plugin [Check My LInks] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/check-my-links/ojkcdipcgfaekbeaelaapakgnjflfglf?hl=en-GB)
